*Real exporting is not currently implemented (2016-06-14)*\\
See [[https://github.com/JohnTigue/EbolaMapper/issues/17][Docs: TBD:
Export HOWTO (Issue #17)]]

Static visualization have their place, of course, in both the web and
print. Omolumeter can be used to generate static files by: - making
screen shots (derp) - printing to PDF - printing to paper

In the future: - Perhaps some map view could be exported as GeoJSON -
D3.js uses SVG, so maybe interactive D3.js-based visualizations well be
able to export excellent static maps and charts.
