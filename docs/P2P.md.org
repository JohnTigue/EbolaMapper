*EbolaMapper* is code that runs completely client-side i.e. in a Web
browser capable of being hosted from a simple static Web server via
http:// URLs and, getting to the point, even from file:// URLs.

Therefore just as *EbolaMapper* can be run in [[Offline Mode]] (i.e.
served via http:// URLs and then cached as a HTML5 Offline Web
applications) if properly package with its data *EbolaMapper* could be
passed between people as a single file. This packaging in a zipfile is
also useful for distribution via USB sticks.

One way for distributing the packaged app is via P2P networks. In that
case there will be multiple versions of *EbolaMapper* packaged with data
for different periods of time.

So, there needs to be a standard file name which indicates what the
files is. Surely it starts with EbolaMapper. Then a [ISO 8601
interval]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601#Time\_intervals). Then
probably a filename extension. For example:\\
EbolaMapper.2014-03-01--2014-11-10.zip

JFT: I did see some mentions of Week10, or Week 12. Not sure I like
that.

Perhaps there should be an
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename][8.3 FILENAME]] for
situations where the OS is old DOS. But would such an OS have the
ability to run a Web browser which can render D3.js apps?
