Seems like he has been working on ebola mapping starting in 2014-08, and
many of [[https://github.com/luiscape?tab=repositories][his
repositories]] should be checked out as he seems to have been cranking
out various screen scrapers to gather ebola data from around the Web.

See [[HDX Repository]] for more on his work.

Judging by [[https://twitter.com/Simon_B_Johnson][his twitter feed]]
he's be paying attention to the data problem since mid 2014-08. He
[[https://twitter.com/Simon_B_Johnson/status/506422860018380800][tweeted
his first ebola visualization]] on 2014-09-01.

He has worked on [[https://simonbjohnson.github.io/][multiple
visualizations and dashboards of the 2014 Ebola Outbreak]]. He seems to
have worked with Luis Capelo on
[[http://simonbjohnson.github.io/Ebola-Narrative/][The Ebola Narrative]]
and is currently maintaining it.

Simon Johnson's ebola visualization work is very good. Note that his
gallery is more about getting the code working. Then he let's others run
with it and pretty it up for public consumption, as happened in the case
of [[http://simonbjohnson.github.io/Ebola-Narrative/][his Ebola
Narrative]] which
[[http://www.letemps.ch/tout_le_temps/le_temps/infographie/2014/ebola/][Le
Temps deployed successfully]].

One can consider his work as evidence that the project's goal (a single
amateur being able to easily and freely produced an outbreak dashboard)
is achievable. Simon, who is very much not an amateur, nonetheless is
essentially cranking out his visualizations solo.

Note that these type of tools can work without a network connection (for
example, [[http://simonbjohnson.github.io/Ebola-Narrative/][The Ebola
Narrative]] has been tested and proven to work when loaded via =file://=
URLs of a local hard drive).

*** Ebola Dashboard

He cranked out high level dashboard which he maintains with fresh data:

In the early days of the West Africa ebola outbreak, Caitlin Rivers
manually collected data from the Web and maintained resulting CVS files
in [[https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola/][a Github repository]], which
was being updated roughly daily with
[[https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola/graphs/contributors][27 people
contributing]] to the repository. Eventually, the WHO started putting
out numbers and the effort was wound down.
