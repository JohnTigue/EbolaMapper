This simply defines some terminology used in the project.

** Ebola2014
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ebola2014
   :END:

=Ebola2014= is this project's short name for the big ebola outbreak of
2014.

It is not clear to me what is the standard for naming epidemic
outbreaks. Historically influenza outbreaks have been
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic][colorfully named]].
Certainly more recent outbreaks are more neutrally named, for example
=H1N1 Flu=.

The WHO does not seem to have a naming convention for
[[http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/history/chronology.html][outbreaks
of ebola]]. It is known that patient zero was a child who died of ebola
in December of 2013 yet the outbreak is described as starting in March
of 2014.
[[http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html][The
CDC calls it the =2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa=]]. It looks like
it is not really a pandemic, but rather it is currently endemic, so
=EbolaPandemic=, although rather unique would be wrong.

Shoot, judging by how they started naming ebola back in 1976, perhaps
they could call it the
=2013 Ebola Outbreak near Equatorial Eastern Atlantic.= In other words:
denial, it's not just a river; and
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_River][neither is Ebola]].

I just do not want type out any of those options many, many times so in
this project =Ebola2014= is used as the the short name for the famous
2014 Ebola outbreak, even though there is a separate ebola outbreak in
The DRC as I type this...

** JFT
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: jft
   :END:

John Tigue's initials are =JFT=. I use those 3 characters as *TODO*
makers in my textual life in general. I am killing them off in this
project. If you find any, that's what is going on.

** Ti Mon Bo
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ti-mon-bo
   :END:

Theme song of this project, off Tito Puente's 1957 album, Top
Percussion. >"Ti" refers to Tito Puente on timbales, "Mon" is Mongo
Santamaria and "Bo" is Willie Bobo on bongos.
