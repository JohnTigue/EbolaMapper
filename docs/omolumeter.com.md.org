The website, [[http://omolumeter.com][omolumeter.com]], serves two main
purposes: - Provide a demo deploy of the [[Omolumeter]] software -
Serve, via an API, a library of documents conformant to [[the
Spec|Outbreak Time Series Specification Overview]]

For the first purpose, any end user can simply navigate via a Web
browser to [[http://omolumeter.com/]]. The root page of that Web site
have a deploy of the [[Omolumeter]].

For the second purpose, various sources of outbreak data on the Web are
curated and made freely available to the web as [[Outbreak Time
Series|Outbreak Time Series Specification Overview]] documents. (Note:
this is more an idea than something that has actually be implemented.
Nonetheless,
[[http://omolumeter.com/data/ebola_2014/ebola_data_db_format.2016_03_20.csv][data]]
is currently available for others to use. Some of this is extremely
basic Web tech, like setting up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
[[https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/][(CORS)]] but the world needs even that
simple level of global outbreak monitoring machinery.
