outbreak\_mapper.html is simply a single page app which hosts the
=outbreak_mapper= widget. Yet it may well be the main user experience,
especially for those who need to take the app to offline contexts.

[Currently, I have no idea what chrome will be the context around the
=outbreak_mapper= widget on =outbreak_mapper.html= but is should show
off how the thing is a white label-able product for the purposes of the
[[White Label]] documentation.

There needs to be a cache.manifest file referenced from the HTML (with
the content type text/cache-manifest) etc. See [[Offline Mode]].
