The site http://eboladata.org is a repository information relevant to the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, mostly in the form of links to information at other sites although there are a few dataset on eboladata.org. Not everything is ebola outbreak specific. For example, [Open Street Map - Republic of Sierra Leone](http://eboladata.org/dataset/open-street-map-republic-sierra-leone) is not specifically about Ebola2014 but maps of West Africa certainly are relevant. OpenStreetMaps is open data, making it especially apropos.

eboladata.org is a deploy of DKAN.

## Ebola Data Jam
The Ebola Data Jam event took place on Saturday, 2014-10-18 in NYC. The event's associated Web site is http://eboladata.org.

Sounds like 81 folks were involved. Apparently they searched the Web for Ebola2014 data and added what they found to http://eboladata.org.
 
# Datasets
The datasets are listed at http://eboladata.org/dataset. The first dataset seems to have been added 2014-10-07. Data sets continue to be added.

| Date | Count |
|------|-------|
| 2014-11-15 | 17 |
| 2014-11-22 | 27 |
| 2014-11-23 | 30 |
| 2014-11-24 | 32 |
| 2014-12-13 | 35 |
| 2014-12-31 | 36 |

[This link](http://eboladata.org/dataset?sort_by=changed&sort_order=DESC) lists the datasets by date-modified, useful for checking for new stuff. 

Following are the datasets listed on http://eboladata.org/dataset, [as sorted by title by eboladata.org](http://eboladata.org/dataset?query=&sort_by=title&sort_order=ASC). The `Useful` column indicates whether the dataset might be useful for developing the [[Outbreak Time Series Specification]] and visualizations that would use Outbreak Dashboard API. This essentially means JSON, well structured XML (not some random xhtml page), or CSV. Randomly structured HTML pages and PDFs do not qualify (others are already on the screen scraping machinery issue). This is not a judgement of the dataset's usefulness in other contexts.

# Analysis
## Short answer 
Moving forward with `Sub-national time series data on Ebola cases and deaths in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal since March 2014`. See [[HDX Repository]] for more details.

`Caitlin Rivers' GitHub` is the place to go for CSV timeseries data.

## Long answer
The EbolaMapper widget will need datasources (i.e. the app and the data are separate things, with the data source being specified via an HTTP URL). We'll need to come up with an API aka data structure to that data but first let's see which of the above 14 are candidates for feeding to EbolaMapper.

The following are quick notes on each of the listed data sources, [sorted by title](http://eboladata.org/dataset?query=&sort_by=title&sort_order=ASC).

##### Caitlin Rivers' GitHub
http://eboladata.org/dataset/caitlin-rivers-github  
- The github links have high quality CSV files. 
- The DataMart stuff mentions APIs but download of files required login, so passed on.
Good stuff. The basis of many folks numbers. See [[Other Coders#caitlin-rivers]] for more info.

##### CrisisNet Ebola data
http://eboladata.org/dataset/crisisnet-ebola-data  
This does have JSON. Not really clear what's going on or what is available. They do have Twitter feeds of "ebola." See, https://github.com/ushahidi/crisisnet

https://twitter.com/IgorBrigadir/status/538006710347386880:  
>has anyone come across a nice API that simply wraps other APIs? e.g. access to municipal data stored across multiple departments... @mikedewar @knowtheory I think @CrisisNET has something like what you describe. Pulls Data from many sources, exposing a single API... we cache transformed/augmented data in the format we use and credit the original source. It's a like a data warehouse.

##### Democratic Republic of Congo Indicators
http://eboladata.org/dataset/democratic-republic-congo-indicators  
This is a subset of Caitlin Rivers' GitHub.  
Ignore this entry but **do** check out her repo. 

##### Ebola Treatment Centers or Units
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebola-treatment-centers-or-units  
>This dataset represents the best-known collection of status and location of the facilities known as Ebola Treatment Centers or Ebola Treatment Units in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Maintained by UNMEER in the HDX website.

Links through to shapefiles and CSVs:  
https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/dataset/ebola-treatment-centers  

So, HDX. Good stuff. Not the first task for EbolaMapper but perhaps.

##### Ebola Treatment Centres, Isolation Wards, Hospitals and Transit Centres
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebola-treatment-centres-isolation-wards-hospitals-and-transit-centres  
Essentially a link to a google doc: http://goo.gl/pVb4GC

This is Simon Johnson and Luis Capelo work so it is good stuff.
Notice the #HXL being used. Updated daily.
This on [GitHub as GeoJson](https://github.com/BrcMapsTeam/Ebola_2014_West_Africa_medical_centres/blob/master/Ebola_medical_centres_open_closed_pending.geojson)

**UPDATE** 2014-12-31, seems this is inactive now and the latest version is to be found at:  
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebola-treatment-centers-or-units

##### Ebola Twitter Data
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebola-twitter-data  
Added on 2014-11-23. Seems like it might be a dataset added but access failed.

##### Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa — The First 9 Months of the Epidemic and Forward Projections
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-%E2%80%94-first-9-months-epidemic-and-forward-projections  
CSV. Quality data.

##### Ebola in Liberia
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebola-liberia   
This is links to ebolainliberia.org  
High quality stuff.

##### EbolaBigData.org Case Counts
http://eboladata.org/dataset/ebolabigdataorg-case-counts  
A link to http://ebolabigdata.org/ where there is a small XLS file with 5 columns: Date, Cases, Death, Diff, Noofdays. Usable but ignore this as there are better, more detailed spreadsheets available else where.

##### Esri Disaster Response Program
http://eboladata.org/dataset/esri-disaster-response-program  

Some good visualizations. E.g.
http://www.esri.com/services/disaster-response/drought-famine-disease/ebola-outbreak-cases

Not free enough with the license:
"Do not copy or reuse without permission from Direct Relief: http://www.directrelief.org/about/faqs/"

pro: OpenStreetMaps

E.g.
http://www.esri.com/services/disaster-response/drought-famine-disease/ebola-outbreak-cases

##### Flowminder Estimated Mobility Patterns for West Africa
http://eboladata.org/dataset/flowminder-estimated-mobility-patterns-west-africa  

Very interesting. Must have come from http://www.flowminder.org/
Large, e.g. 20Mb, CSV files of predicted motion between regions, based on cell phone data. Might make for an interesting vis.

##### Guinea official socio economic statistics
http://eboladata.org/dataset/guinea-official-socio-economic-statistics  
Failed to get to data via UI...

##### Health Map RSS
http://eboladata.org/dataset/health-map-rss  
A link to http://healthmap.org/rss/ebola-all.rss  
Seemingly a collection of news items about ebola.
Has geo info for each item:
```xml
<georss:point>-25.734970 134.489563</georss:point>
<geo:lat>-25.734970</geo:lat>
<geo:long>134.489563</geo:long>
```

##### Humanitarian Data Exchange
http://eboladata.org/dataset/humanitarian-data-exchange
The #1 site on the Web for ebola info. See [[HDX Repository]]

##### Liberia Ministry of Health & Social Welfare
http://eboladata.org/dataset/liberia-ministry-health-social-welfare  
>Situation reports on disease incidence, treatment statistics, contact tracing, requests for resources, general humanitarian conditions

These are PDFs. Some are data rich and contain maps, graphs, and table. But there must be more direct ways to get at the raw data than ripping up PDFs. Other folks are already on the PDF and Web page scraping problems.

##### Liberia official economic data
http://eboladata.org/dataset/liberia-official-economic-data  
>Economic data and some national statistics on vehicles, communication and crime.
A link http://liberia.africadata.org/en/BulkDownload

##### Liberia official economic data 
http://eboladata.org/dataset/liberia-official-regional-statistics  
>Economic data and some national statistics on vehicles, communication and crime.
A link to http://liberia.africadata.org/en/BulkDownload

##### Liberia official trade data
http://eboladata.org/dataset/liberia-official-trade-data  
>Official data on export, import and balance of various commodities and products.
A link to  http://liberia.africadata.org/en/BulkDownload

##### NetHope Open Humanitarian Data Repository
http://eboladata.org/dataset/nethope-open-humanitarian-data-repository

This does seem to be raw data (CSV, REST, JSON, APIs). Broken out for countries in West Africa.
E.g.
http://services1.arcgis.com/ZGrptGlLV2IILABw/arcgis/rest/services/EbolaCountriesUpdatedAugust15/FeatureServer/0  
http://services1.arcgis.com/ZGrptGlLV2IILABw/arcgis/rest/services/EbolaCountriesUpdatedAugust15/FeatureServer/0?f=pjson  
There might be some rendering going on as well, dunno site was very slow on 2014-11-12.

##### Non-Governmental Organizations Responding to Ebola
http://eboladata.org/dataset/non-governmental-organizations-responding-ebola  
>This is a list of all of the NGOs that are responding to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Produced by Center for International Disaster Information, United States Agency for International Development. Original source: http://www.cidi.org/ebola-ngos

A CSV file list of 58 NGO (name, URL). The file is at eboladata.org, not just a link.

##### Open Street Map - Republic of Sierra Leone
http://eboladata.org/dataset/open-street-map-republic-sierra-leone  
>Basic geographic details of Sierra Leone - includes roads, railways, natural features, etc.

A link to http://download.geofabrik.de/africa/sierra-leone-latest.shp.zip which is a 1Mb ZIP file contain the OpenStreetMap shapefiles for Sierra Leone

##### OpenStreetMap - Republic of Guinea
http://eboladata.org/dataset/openstreetmap-republic-guinea  
>Basic geographic details of the Republic of Guinea - includes roads, railways, natural features, etc.

A link to http://download.geofabrik.de/africa/guinea-latest.shp.zip. I am assuming that is the shapefiles for Guinea

##### OpenStreetMap - Republic of Liberia
http://eboladata.org/dataset/openstreetmap-republic-liberia  
>Basic geographic details of Liberia - includes roads, railways, natural features, etc.

A link to htttp://download.geofabrik.de/africa/liberia-latest.shp.zip. I assume that is the shapefiles for Liberia.

##### ReliefWeb
>A specialised digital service of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Maps and infographics on cases, treatment centers, intervention efforts and funding, telecommunications, general humanitarian conditions

A link to http://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2014-000041-gin

ReliefWeb is a good thing but these seem to be reports as PDFs and maps, not JSON, XML, or CSV.

##### Sierra Leone Health Facilities
http://eboladata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-health-facilities  
Could be useful but duplicate of info that is already on HDX.

##### Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation
http://eboladata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-ministry-health-and-sanitation  
>Updates and situation reports on disease incidence, treatment statistics, contact tracing Numerical data extracted by Caitlin Rivers on GitHub: http://github.com/cmrivers/ebola Suggested uses: epidemiology, intervention planning, contact tracing

2 links through to PDFs:  
- [Ebola Virus Disease Updates](http://health.gov.sl/?page_id=576)
- [Ebola Situation Reports](http://health.gov.sl/?page_id=583)

So, good stuff but PDF and Rivers is already translating that to CSV.

##### Sierra Leone Open Government Initiative
http://eboladata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-open-government-initiative  
A link to http://ogi.gov.sl/content/transparency-sierra-leone-registries  

##### Sierra Leone official regional statistics
http://eboladata.org/dataset/sierra-leone-official-regional-statistics  
>Statistical data for Sierra Leone and its areas and districts.

A link to http://sierraleone.africadata.org/en/BulkDownload  

##### Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Modeler Ebola Parameter Comparison
http://eboladata.org/dataset/spatio-temporal-epidemiological-modeler-ebola-parameter-comparison
>This data source by the spatio-temporal epidemiological modeler (STEM) team gives epidemiological parameters for Ebola from different sources.

A small CSV ebola_param_comparison.csv, seems to be the output of a modeler of this ebola by country. E.g. Basic Reproductive Number, #day from onset to end of infectiousness.

##### Standby Task Force
http://eboladata.org/dataset/standby-task-force  
>Comprehensive crowd-sourced maps of health facilities and related data: hospitals, laboratories, Ebola treatment centers, health centers, pharmacies Suggested uses: intervention and health facility planning, humanitarian resource allocation

A link to http://standbytaskforce.maps.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html

SBTF is doing great work. The above link can be followed to their [tools](http://standbytaskforce.maps.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html#c=organization&o=modified&f=tools) but that wasn't showing any content on 2014-12-31. There has to be more but this link is not the way forward.

##### Sub-national time series data on Ebola cases and deaths in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal since March 2014  
http://eboladata.org/dataset/sub-national-time-series-data-ebola-cases-and-deaths-guinea-liberia-sierra-leone-nigeria-and
>Ebola outbreak time series data at national and sub national levels since March 2014. Data compiled manually from a number of published reports. Updated by OCHA ROWCA every working day.
  
JFT(2014-11-14): Wow, this is the name of the HDX dataset I finally settled on using. Sadly there was no link to be found on eboladata.org. Well, whatever, a week later: https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/dataset/rowca-ebola-cases

##### The Microbe-scope
http://eboladata.org/dataset/microbe-scope  
A CSV with numbers on 40 different infectious disease. Lists attributes of each disease: Fatality rate, basic reproductive number, survival time, yearly fatalities, and lots more. This could be useful if one wants to compare ebola to other diseases.

##### UK redcross data on cases, deaths, treatment centers
http://eboladata.org/dataset/uk-redcross-data-cases-deaths-treatment-centers  
Good stuff.  
2 links to Simon Johnsons Ebola Dashboard.
the viz: http://simonbjohnson.github.io/Ebola_Dashboard/
the github: https://github.com/SimonbJohnson/Ebola_Dashboard/tree/gh-pages

##### Wikipedia Case Counts
http://eboladata.org/dataset/wikipedia-case-counts  
>Wikipedia record of major Ebola virus outbreaks by country and by date – 3 September to most recent WHO / Gov update.

A link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa#Understanding_the_data_and_its_limitations

##### World Health Organisation
http://eboladata.org/dataset/world-health-organisation  
>Ebola data and news maintained by the World Health Organisation... Not an API but the WHO website with news and data.

A link to: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/  
Not accepted for this project since others are working on the screen scraping route.

**UPDATE** by 2014-12-31 this has more links some of which are directly useful:  
- [Sit Reps](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.ebola-sitrep) in "csv, Excel, html, xml"
- [Sit Reps, more detail](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/)
- http://maps.who.int/MapGallery/ (maps; but raw data?)

##### Worldwide Flights
http://eboladata.org/dataset/worldwide-flights  
>All airports, airlines, and routes available from OpenFlights http://openflights.org/data.html. In addition, there are compiled files which make the data more useful for analysis.

Two files: Flights Shapefile and CSV of known flights.
