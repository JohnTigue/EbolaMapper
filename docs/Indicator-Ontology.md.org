This wiki page is about defining an ontology of infectious disease
outbreak indicators. Such an ontology is a deliverable of this Outbreak
Time Series project. Examples of the kind of indicators the ontology
should address include: - "All deaths in the last 7 days" - "Cumulative
suspected cases to date, in women" - "Cumulative deaths, percentage of
which are from the last 3 weeks"

** Introduction @@html:<a name='intro'/>@@
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: introduction
   :END:

So, the task this page is addressing is to map out and name well various
topics embedded in such indicator names. For example, seemingly
=confidence= is a dimension/property with values =suspected=,
=probable=, and =confirmed=. Another property seems to be =deaths=
versus =cases=. There are populations and sub-populations. Etc. This
ontology will be mapped to RDF and serialized as CSVW table annotations,
see [[https://www.w3.org/ns/csvw][CSVW Namespace Vocabulary Terms]] for
further information on where RDF and CSVW meet.

This page is currently broken out from the Specs in order to provide
easy focus on just the ontology during its development, without having
to wade into formal specification language of a work in progress.

The [[Outbreak Time Series Specification]] (the Spec) will use this
ontology. This page may well get folded into the Spec. Alternatively,
there is precedence in web standards to have "well known vocabularies"
as separate specs, both of which get released simultaneous. The idea
being that the core spec is designed to be extensible. Inevitably, there
will be a need for indicators that are not covered in this "well known
vocabulary" spec. So make the core extensible, and separately use those
extension mechanism to inject a vocabulary of frequently seen
indicators, as defined in this vocabulary spec for an ontology of common
epidemiological indicators.

** Target audience and author @@html:<a name='targets'/>@@
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: target-audience-and-author
   :END:

The target audience for this document is epidemiology domain experts who
would like to contribute to the discussion of this ontology. By
separating this page from the Spec, such experts can quickly read this
page and easily leave comments. If you are such a person, please just
hit the edit button and type away in this wiki page. This page is under
version control; any changes can be rolled back, so not to worry. If you
do not have and do not want a (free) GitHub account you cannot edit this
page. In that case feel free to email comment to
[[mailto:john@tigue.com][John Tigue (john@tigue.com)]].

The original author of this document is John Tigue; hopefully others
will contribute. I (John Tigue) am not an expert in the epidemiology
field so please feel free to provide feedback which differs radically
from is presented here. (Heck, I don't even know if "indicators" is the
right term.) I am simply a programmer with standards body experience who
saw a place where he could contribute by driving the definition of a
spec and building software (visualization, translators, validators,
etc.) that works with the spec.

Any existing definitional standards should be used. For example, the
[[http://disease-ontology.org/][Disease Ontology]] is being used. Is
there some already worked out ontology for indicators? That should be
used. Please speak up if you know of any thing. Maybe even a good text
book?

There is no official standards body which is defining this
specification. This is a completely informal process at this time. If
this project proves valuable, the end definition of success would be to
transfer the work to a standards body. At that time John Tigue simply
becomes the spec editor and reference implementation coder. The
reference implementation is called [[Omolumeter]].

** Meta terminology: ontology versus schema
@@html:<a name='terminology' />@@
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: meta-terminology-ontology-versus-schema
   :END:

This ontology is an abstract concept design for consumption by human
minds; the ontology provides common understanding between humans. The
Spec is designed for consumption by machines. The ontology is to be
encoded in the Spec as a schema.

For more background on the distinction made here between ontology and
schema, see
[[https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ontology-and-database-schema-What-s-the-difference-Uschold/b44fa4592b69183c1965d0075dea1a3bc58dfbfe/pdf][Ontologies
and Database Schema: What's the Difference?]]. Simply take "database
schema" in those slides to mean CSVW schema.

** Goal @@html:<a name='goal'/>@@
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: goal
   :END:

The goal of this project is to make outbreak time series data become
first class objects of the Web, encoded in a machine readable fashion
based on the Web's native data standards such as JSON and CSVW. The
specific task of this page is to build a data type for identities of
infectious disease outbreak indicators such as =cases_confirmed=,
=deaths_suspected=, =deaths_probable=, etc.

In programmer terminology when information is enters or exits a running
programs, the thing exchanged is called a serialization. A serialization
is often called a document, for example "Outbreak Time Series conformant
documents." A serialization may be the contents of a file on a file
system, or it may be the payload of an HTTP message sent over the web.

Documents conformant to the Spec contain data typed by the schema. The
Spec uses [[https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page][CSVW]] for the
schema. Serialized, this is a small-ish JSON file. The main data of an
outbreak time series is a CSV file. So, the ontology defined here is
simple a way of saying something like "column 3 of that CSV contains
cumulative suspected cases to date."

In CSVW, having a schema of well defined indicators enables expressing
assertions such as "column 7 of that CSV contains the same information
as that other CSV." The Spec is written such that the set of indicators
is not fix; there is an extension mechanism for indicators not defined
in this ontology. In this way, the goal is to create a standard that can
be easily used across the web on multiple web sites for the exchange of
outbreak data.

   their Gemina project (http://gemina.tigr.org). This ontology is
   ordered in a hierarchical manner with diseases arranged in order of
   increasing specificity of disease descriptions. The ontology provides
   standardized disease names, as well as commonly-used synonyms for the
   disease as used in medical literature.

** Early work from the Spec @@html:<a name='early_spec' />@@
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: early-work-from-the-spec
   :END:

v0.0.1 of the Spec was pre-defining the following: - =otss_cases_all= -
=otss_cases_probable= - =otss_cases_suspected= - =otss_cases_confirmed=
- =otss_deaths_all= - =otss_deaths_probable= - =otss_deaths_suspected= -
=otss_deaths_confirmed= - =otss_basic_reproductive_number=

** Indicators: types and attribute dimensions
@@html:<a name='indicators'/>@@
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: indicators-types-and-attribute-dimensions
   :END:

As seen in the above list, even a small set of indicator names shows
some internal structure that should be teased out. One dimension seems
to be [cases, deaths] and another dimension seems to have values
[probable, suspected, confirmed]. Is the latter the same dimension that
has values "all" and "discarded" or is there another dimension at play?
Etc. What dimensions need to be modeled in the indicator ontological?

These indicators can add up quickly. One
[[https://github.com/JohnTigue/outbreak_time_series_data/blob/master/disease/disease_by_infectious_agent/viral_infectious_disease/Ebola_hemorrhagic_fever/who.by_county.2016_03_20.csv][WHO
CSV file on Ebola 2014]] had about thirty indicators.

The follow dimensions are basic and easy to classify: - Subject - cases
- deaths - (Perhaps this is =outcome=: death, active, recovery, where
cases = active+recovery but not deaths?) - Veracity - suspected -
probable - confirmed - discarded *TODO* Is this one actually an value of
another dimension? - all (lame label, and what does it even mean?) -
Lag, temporal offset - [ ] notice how these define repeated structures
just at different delays - now (default - X intervals (or Y day?) Ebola
data has 7 days and 21 days - incubation periods ago?

The following observed indicators are more complex: - CFR - this is the
combo of a subject and attribute; has details - count, percentage, cfr
(is CFR it's own dimension?) - "cumulative deaths, of which % from last
3 weeks - What about, for e.g., "cases suspected per 1000" and "cases
confirmed per 1000"? The "per 1000" is a different dimension of
attribute typing, no? - =otss_basic_reproductive_number=

*TODO* Can =otss_basic_reproductive_number= really change per interval?
I guess it could if the pathogen evolves. Perhaps this is a property of
something else, say the outbreak rather than a specific interval?
Perhaps what should happen is that the ontology is a spec unto its own.
Then OTSS uses it in two places: on individual intervals or on the
outbreak's metadata

Diseases need short formal names to be referred to by internally within

name labels - [ ] What is this standard naming schema which generates
name labels? - e.g.s - =IAV=: influenza A - =MERS-CoV=: Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - =ZIKV=, =EBOV=, =CHIKV=,
=HCV= - what about ZIKV versus ZIKV disease (ZVD)? Which should be the
label?

-  URI scheme for diseases

-  DOID's seem awfully promising as URI parameters, e.g.: "DOID:1234"
   which could be `/by\_DOID/1234'
