The [[http://www.meetup.com/Africa-Open-Data/][Africa Open Data Group]]
(AODG) is: >Open Data is a transformational trend in Open Governance
that is generating empowerment and economic growth. Around the world,
cities, states, and nations are publishing Open Data and creating new
data supply chains and ecosystems that are managing scarce water
resources, improving land use and agricultural security, enhancing
transportation and traffic flows, and generating new high-tech jobs and
tax revenues. Governments themselves are benefiting because published
Open Data is free of organizational barriers that hold back departments
from sharing information and collaborating.

  This Group is designed to be interactive, informative, and fun. It
  will involve diverse skills and experiences, and showcase real live
  examples of how Open Data works, African Challenges and opportunities,
  and example applications. There will be online and real face to face
  meetups and conferences, online collaboration in global communities
  working to help Africa become a leader in Open Government and Open
  Data. Our goal is to create new global relationships that bring
  passionate Open Data communities together to share common challenges
  and build new solutions. It doesn't matter where you live, where you
  were born, or where you work. We are looking for Citizens of the World
  to work together to help African countries embrace Open Government and
  Open Data.

This project (*EbolaMapper*, not AODG) got started because John Tigue
was really bothered by the lack of Ebola2014 visualizations on the Web.
Then he opened his big mouth on
[[http://www.meetup.com/Africa-Open-Data/events/210071892/][the
2014-11-07 AODG conference call]] committing to banging out a
visualization in order to confirm some of the data found during [[the
Ebola Data Jam|Datasets Listed on eboladata.org#ebola-data-jam]]. What
was supposed to be a day or so of banging out a nifty visualization
using the official data turned out to be much more than that.
