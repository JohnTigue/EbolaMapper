Open Humanitarian Data Repository (OHDR)\\

This is a project of NetHope(http://nethope.org/) so I expect there will
be APIs there soon, hopefully [[Outbreak APIs]] will be part of it.

NetHope is running the cell network the #TackleEbola provided
smartphones will communicate with. Therefore this seem like a natural
place for the info to surface.
