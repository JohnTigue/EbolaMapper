  Generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward,
  consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product
  architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches. They
  offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so
  could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different
  package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and
  unimportant to, the mainstream.
