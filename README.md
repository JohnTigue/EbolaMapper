EbolaMapper
===========

Widget for visualizing ebola outbreak data on maps, through time. In other words, "modern open-source anti-virus software." Let's break out those terms:

Modern: basically that means highly interacive Web based visualizations (read: d3.js). We can really up the game compared to what usually happens (mostly static data in PDFs which, by the way, we can print-to-file quite attractively from the SVG-based d3.js visualizations).

Open-source: The code is Apache 2.0 licensed (i.e. do with it as you wish) and the data is also free (of cost and control).

Anti-virus software: Ebola is a virus, this software project is anti ebola, and pro geeky humor.


Fork this repository if you want to deploy EbolaMapper. Styling (CSS, etc.) and data sources are easy to set. There are sane defaults such that you can just grab a copy and be quickly up and running.
