This document describes how to deploy Omolumeter. For customizing the
look (colors, fonts, etc.) see also [[White Labeling]]. Since Omolumeter
is licensed such that anyone is free to do anything with the source
code, modifying the code is an avenue to endless possibilities; this
document is for the simpler deploy use cases.

** Configuring Omolumeter's data source

Perhaps even a default relative file URL so folks can just drop a
properly named data file in the same directory as omolumeter and be off
and running without even looking in any HTML or JS files. Make it a
directory s.t. directory listing can provide multiple files? But that
leaves open much potential complication (does the server has Collection
Indexing on? Which servers?).

*** URL paramaters
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: url-paramaters
    :END:

-  *css=xzy*: CSS file, possibly remote. Say, the widget is hosted on
   server-a.com but visually is embedded in an iframe on a page on
   server-b.com (e.g. The Economist has done iframe embedding with their
   D3 ebola widget). If server-b.com is concerned about the widget
   having the same styling a the rest of server-b.com then the widget
   loaded into the iframe via a server-a.com URL can have as an URL
   param the name of a CSS file on server-b.com. If the widget is iframe
   embeddedy, no end user would see an nasty long URL with tons of
   params on it. If long URLs are a concern then use the default CSS
   URL, or go in and modify the code.
